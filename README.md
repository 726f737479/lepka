**Lepka** is a lightweight library that provides super easy interface for navigation within Android app.
Best used with **MVP** or **MVVM** architecture.

## Setup 
The principle of the library is built on the fact that the application has modules that unite the common logic and screens that implement this logic.

### Screens definition 
**Screen** is an abstraction that defines a specific logical part of the application. **Lepka** allows you to send additional data to the **Screens** that can then be extracted. Implementation base on **Fragments API**.
```kotlin
object LoginScreen : LepkaScreen(LoginFragment::class.java)

object NewsScreen : LepkaScreen(NewsFragment::class.java)

object MessagesScreen : LepkaScreen(MessagesFragment::class.java)

object AccountScreen : LepkaScreen(AccountFragment::class.java)

class PageScreen(title: String, count: Int) : LepkaScreen(PageFragment::class.java) {

    init {
        data.putString(EXTRA_PAGE_TITLE, title)
        data.putInt(EXTRA_PAGE_COUNT, count)
    }
}

class ChatScreen(title: String) : LepkaScreen(ChatFragment::class.java) {

    init { data.putString(EXTRA_CHAT_TITLE, title) }
}
```

### Modules definition 
**Module** is an entity that combines the logical all-encompassing parts of the application, in our case it's **Screens**. Based on the data that **Module**s provide, **Lepka** can decide whether to open a new activity or use current one to display the desired **Screen**.
```kotlin
class AuthorizationModule : LepkaModule() {

    override fun provideContainer() = R.id.container

    override fun getActivityClass() = AuthorizationActivity::class.java

    override fun canOpen(screen: Screen) = screen is LoginScreen
}

class HomeModule : LepkaModule() {

    ...

    override fun canOpen(screen: Screen) = screen is NewsScreen
            || screen is PageScreen
            || screen is MessagesScreen
            || screen is AccountScreen
}

class ChatModule : LepkaModule() {

    ...

    override fun canOpen(screen: Screen) = screen is ChatScreen
}
```
### Screens colision
Sometimes you may have a situation where several **Modules** can open the same screen, this problem can be resolved by overriding Priority for specific **Screen** in the desired **Module**. Default **Priority** of each screen is `Priority.HIGH`.
```kotlin
class ChatModule : BaseModule() {

    ...

    override fun getPriority(screen: Screen) 
            = if (screen is ProfileScreen) Priority.MEDIUM else Priority.HIGH
}
```

### Initialization 
**Lepka** must be initialized only once and applicationÂ must have only single instance for it.
```kotlin
val modules = Arrays.asList<Module>(

        AuthorizationModule(),
        HomeModule(),
        ChatModule())

val lepka = LepkaBuilder()
        .setApplication(app)
        .setUseSupport(true)
        .registerModules(modules)
        .setEntryScreen(AuthorizationScreen())
        .build()
```

## Usage
Switching between screens has never been so easy :)

### Naviagation
You just need to tell **Lepka** which command you want to execute, and it does everything itself. Available commands: `Forward(screen), Back(), ForwardPop(screen), BackTo(screen)`
```kotlin
lepka.execute(Command)
```

#### Forward
Using this **Command** you can navigates to next **Screen**. If current **Module** can open **Screen**, it will be opened in a same module. Otherwise **Screen** will be opened in module that can do this.

#### Back
Using this **Command** you can navigates to previous **Screen**. If current **Screen** is last in a backstack of current **Module**, module will be also closed. If current **Module** is last in a backstack of application, application will close.

#### ForwardClear
Using this **Command** you can navigates to next **Screen** and clear backstack. If **Screen** can be opened in the same module, only current module screens backstack will be clreared. Otherwise all modules backstack will be clreared.

#### BackTo
Using this **Command** you can navigates back to specified **Screen**. If current **Module** backstack doesn't containes specified **Screen**, current **Module** will be closed and so on until the **Lepka** finds the right screen. If no prev moduled doesn't have this screen in backstack, application will close.  

### Retrieve screen data
All data that you pass to **Screen** is stored in **Fragment** arguments.
```kotlin
val data = fragment.arguments
```
