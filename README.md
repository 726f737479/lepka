# Lepka
Lepka is a lightweight library that provides super easy interface for navigation within Android app.
Best used with **MVP** or **MVVM** architecture.

## Setup 
The principle of the library is built on the fact that the application has modules that unite the common logic and screens that implement this logic.

### Screens definition 
**Screen** is an abstraction that defines a specific logical part of the application. **Lepka** allows you to send additional data to the **Screens** that can then be extracted. Implementation base on **Fragments API**.
```kotlin
class RegistrationScreen : BaseScreen() {

    override fun getFragmentClass() = RegistrationFragment::class.java
}

class LoginScreen: BaseScreen() {

    override fun getFragmentClass() = LoginFragment::class.java
}

class FeedScreen : BaseScreen() {

    override fun getFragmentClass() = FeedFragment::class.java
}

class ProfileScreen(data: Data<User>) : BaseScreen(data) {

    override fun getFragmentClass() = ProfileFragment::class.java
}

class MessagesScreen : BaseScreen() {

    override fun getFragmentClass() = MessagesFragment::class.java
}

class ChatScreen(data: Data<Int>) : BaseScreen(data) {

    override fun getFragmentClass() = ChatFragment::class.java
}
```
### Modules definition 
The module is an entity that combines the logical all-encompassing parts of the application, in our case it's **Screens**. Based on the data that **Module**s provide, **Lepka** can decide whether to open a new activity or use current one to display the desired **Screen**.
```kotlin
class AuthorizationModule : BaseModule() {

    override fun provideContainer() = R.id.container

    override fun getActivityClass() = AuthorizationActivity::class.java

    override fun canOpen(screen: Screen)
            = screen is RegistrationScreen || screen is LoginScreen
}

class HomeModule : BaseModule() {

    override fun provideContainer() = R.id.container

    override fun getActivityClass() = HomeActivity::class.java

    override fun canOpen(screen: Screen)
            = screen is FeedScreen || screen is ProfileScreen || screen is MessagesScreen
}

class ChatModule : BaseModule() {

    override fun provideContainer()= R.id.container

    override fun getActivityClass() = ChatActivity::class.java

    override fun canOpen(screen: Screen)
            = screen is ChatScreen || screen is ProfileScreen
}
```
### Screens colision
Sometimes you may have a situation where several **Modules** can open the same screen, this problem can be resolved by overriding Priority for specific **Screen** in the desired **Module**. Default **Priority** of each screen is `Priority.HIGH`.
```kotlin
class ChatModule : BaseModule() {

    ...

    override fun getPriority(screen: Screen) 
            = if (screen is ProfileScreen) Priority.MEDIUM else Priority.HIGH
}
```

### Initialization 
**Lepka** must be initialized only once and applicationÂ must have only single instance for it.
```kotlin
val modules = Arrays.asList<Module>(

        AuthorizationModule(),
        HomeModule(),
        ChatModule())

val lepka = LepkaBuilder()
        .setApplication(app)
        .setUseSupport(true)
        .registerModules(modules)
        .setEntryScreen(PickerScreen())
        .build()
```

## Usage
Switching between screens has never been so easy :)

### Naviagation
You just need to tell **Lipka** which command you want to execute, and it does everything itself. Available commands: `Forward(screen), Back()` soon appear: `ForwardPop(screen), BackTo(screen)`
```kotlin
lepka.execute(Forward(LoginScreen()))

lepka.execute(Forward(ProfileScreen(user)))

lepka.execute(Back(()))
```

### Retrieve screen data
When your **Screen** is opened you can retrieve all the data you sent with just one line of code.
```kotlin
val screenKey = KeysUtil.getScreenKey(fragmentArguments)
val user      = lepka.produceScreenData(screenKey)
```
